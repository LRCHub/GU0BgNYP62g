Time, the future's in my mind,
I know the game
I can feel the power
of the night,
a big desire
Time, emotion in my eyes,
you know my game
I can' t leave without
my love tonight,
I'm crazy
Why, in the middle of the night
I call your name
Save my heart, it's beatin' fast
My love is ready all the time
Stay,
forever my game is good to play
Incredible story if you
Stay, I need you today
My heart is on fire,
please don't leave this way
Stay,
whenever you want to
feel the same
Forever I need you if you
Stay, my heart is okay
Together we'll spend our life
forever more
Time, you make me feel so high,
it's right tonight
I can get the rhythm of tonight,
a good vibration
Time, my dream is not delight,
you know again
I can see your love without my
tears,
oh baby
Why, in the middle of the night
I call your name
Save my heart, it's beatin' fast
My love is ready all the time
Stay,
forever my game is good to play
Incredible story if you
Stay, I need you today
My heart is on fire,
please don't leave this way
Stay,
whenever you want to feel the
same
Forever I need you if you
Stay, my heart is okay
Together we'll spend our life
forever more
Stay,
forever my game is good to play
Incredible story if you
Stay, I need you today
My heart is on fire,
please don't leave this way
Stay,
whenever you want to feel the
same
Forever I need you if you
Stay, my heart is okay
Together we'll spend our life
forever more
Stay,
forever my game is good to play
Incredible story if you
Stay, I need you today
My heart is on fire,
please don't leave this way
Stay,
whenever you want to feel the
same
Forever I need you if you
Stay, my heart is okay
Together we'll spend our life
forever more
